-- The compositor's half of hyprfocus: read the declaration, apply what a mode

-- This is the seam between the pure modules and the running desk. Everything
-- it calls is decided elsewhere — `resolve` says what a mode means, `plan`
-- says what would change — so the only judgement here is which registries to
-- hand the answer to, and in what order.
--
-- Deliberately NOT wired to any event yet. `apply` is a function that has to
-- be called; nothing calls it. Making a mode change actually move the desk is
-- the step where a mistake is felt, and it should land when someone is
-- watching a reload rather than as a side effect of a config load.

---Order matters, and it is the order that keeps windows reachable:
---
---  1. binding trees, because withdrawing one is instant and costs nothing
---  2. restore, so a workspace this mode admits gets its windows back before
---     anything looks at what is standing where
---  3. hold, emptying the workspaces about to be withdrawn
---  4. withdraw, which now finds them empty and can actually take them away
---
---Holding before withdrawing is not a preference. A workspace disabled while
---its windows stand on it leaves them somewhere the user cannot reach, and the
---registry refuses to do it — so without step 3, step 4 would silently do
---nothing at all.

---blocked on that would drop every keypress meanwhile.
